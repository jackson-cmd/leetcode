Given a string `s`, remove duplicate letters so that every letter appears once and only once. You must make sure your result is **the smallest in lexicographical order** among all possible results.

**Note:** This question is the same as 1081: https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-subsequence-of-distinct-characters/

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "bcabc"
Output: "abc"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "cbacdcbc"
Output: "acdb"
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 104`
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters.

```
class Solution {
    public String removeDuplicateLetters(String s) {

        Stack<Character> stack = new Stack<>();

        // this lets us keep track of what's in our solution in O(1) time
        HashSet<Character> seen = new HashSet<>();

        // this will let us know if there are any more instances of s[i] left in s
        HashMap<Character, Integer> last_occurrence = new HashMap<>();
        for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) last_occurrence.put(s.charAt(i), i);

        for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++){
            char c = s.charAt(i);
            // we can only try to add c if it's not already in our solution
            // this is to maintain only one of each character
            if (!seen.contains(c)){
                // if the last letter in our solution:
                //     1. exists
                //     2. is greater than c so removing it will make the string smaller
                //     3. it's not the last occurrence
                // we remove it from the solution to keep the solution optimal
                while(!stack.isEmpty() && c < stack.peek() && last_occurrence.get(stack.peek()) > i){
                    seen.remove(stack.pop());
                }
                seen.add(c);
                stack.push(c);
            }
        }
    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(stack.size());
    for (Character c : stack) sb.append(c.charValue());
    return sb.toString();
    }
}
```
