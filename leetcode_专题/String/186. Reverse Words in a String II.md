Given a character array `s`, reverse the order of the **words**.

A **word** is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The **words** in `s` will be separated by a single space.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = ["t","h","e"," ","s","k","y"," ","i","s"," ","b","l","u","e"]
Output: ["b","l","u","e"," ","i","s"," ","s","k","y"," ","t","h","e"]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = ["a"]
Output: ["a"]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 105`
- `s[i]` is an English letter (uppercase or lowercase), digit, or space `' '`.
- There is **at least one** word in `s`.
- `s` does not contain leading or trailing spaces.
- All the words in `s` are guaranteed to be separated by a single space.

 

**Follow up:** Could you do it **in-place** without allocating extra space?

```
class Solution {
  public void reverse(char[] s, int left, int right) {
    while (left < right) {
      char tmp = s[left];
      s[left++] = s[right];
      s[right--] = tmp;
    }
  }

  public void reverseEachWord(char[] s) {
    int n = s.length;
    int start = 0, end = 0;

    while (start < n) {
      // go to the end of the word
      while (end < n && s[end] != ' ') ++end;
      // reverse the word
      reverse(s, start, end - 1);
      // move to the next word
      start = end + 1;
      ++end;
    }
  }

  public void reverseWords(char[] s) {
    // reverse the whole string
    reverse(s, 0, s.length - 1);

    // reverse each word
    reverseEachWord(s);
  }
}
```
