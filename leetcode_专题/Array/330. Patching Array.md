Given a sorted positive integer array *nums* and an integer *n*, add/patch elements to the array such that any number in range `[1, n]` inclusive can be formed by the sum of some elements in the array. Return the minimum number of patches required.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,3], n = 6
Output: 1 
Explanation:
Combinations of nums are [1], [3], [1,3], which form possible sums of: 1, 3, 4.
Now if we add/patch 2 to nums, the combinations are: [1], [2], [3], [1,3], [2,3], [1,2,3].
Possible sums are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, which now covers the range [1, 6].
So we only need 1 patch.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,5,10], n = 20
Output: 2
Explanation: The two patches can be [2, 4].
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,2], n = 5
Output: 0
```

```
public class Solution {
    public int minPatches(int[] nums, int n) {
        int patches = 0, i = 0;
        long miss = 1; // use long to avoid integer overflow error
        while (miss <= n) {
            if (i < nums.length && nums[i] <= miss) // miss is covered
                miss += nums[i++];
            else { // patch miss to the array
                miss += miss;
                patches++; // increase the answer
            }
        }
        return patches;
    }
}
```
