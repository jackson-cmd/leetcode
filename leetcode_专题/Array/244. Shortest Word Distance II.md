Design a class which receives a list of words in the constructor, and implements a method that takes two words *word1* and *word2* and return the shortest distance between these two words in the list. Your method will be called *repeatedly* many times with different parameters. 

**Example:**
Assume that words = `["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"]`.

```
Input: word1 = “coding”, word2 = “practice”
Output: 3
Input: word1 = "makes", word2 = "coding"
Output: 1
```

**Note:**
You may assume that *word1* **does not equal to** *word2*, and *word1* and *word2* are both in the list.

```
class WordDistance {
    HashMap<String, ArrayList<Integer>> locations;
    public WordDistance(String[] words) {
        this.locations = new HashMap<String, ArrayList<Integer>>();
        for (int i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
            
            ArrayList<Integer> loc = this.locations.getOrDefault(words[i], new ArrayList<Integer>());
            loc.add(i);
            this.locations.put(words[i], loc);
        }
    }
    
    public int shortest(String word1, String word2) {
        ArrayList<Integer> loc1, loc2;
        loc1 = this.locations.get(word1);
        loc2 = this.locations.get(word2);
        int l1 = 0, l2 = 0, minDiff = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        while (l1 < loc1.size() && l2 < loc2.size()) {
            minDiff = Math.min(minDiff, Math.abs(loc1.get(l1) - loc2.get(l2)));
            if (loc1.get(l1) < loc2.get(l2)) {
                l1++;
            } else {
                l2++;
            }
        }

        return minDiff;
    }
}
```
