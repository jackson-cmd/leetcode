Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the [definition of h-index on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index): "A scientist has index *h* if *h* of his/her *N* papers have **at least** *h* citations each, and the other *N âˆ’ h* papers have **no more than** *h* citations each."

**Example:**

```
Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
Output: 3 
Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had 
             received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. 
             Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining 
             two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.
```

**Note:** If there are several possible values for *h*, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

```
class Solution {
    public int hIndex(int[] c) {
        Arrays.sort(c);
        int a=0;
        for(int i=0; i<c.length/2; i++){
            int tmp = c[i];
            c[i] = c[c.length -i -1];
            c[c.length -i -1] = tmp;
        }
        while(a<c.length && a<c[a]){
            a++;
        }
        return a;
    }
}
```
