Given an array of citations **sorted in ascending order** (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the [definition of h-index on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index): "A scientist has index *h* if *h* of his/her *N* papers have **at least** *h* citations each, and the other *N âˆ’ h* papers have **no more than** *h* citations each."

**Example:**

```
Input: citations = [0,1,3,5,6]
Output: 3 
Explanation: [0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had 
             received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively. 
             Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining 
             two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.
```

**Note:**

If there are several possible values for *h*, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

**Follow up:**

- This is a follow up problem to [H-Index](https://leetcode.com/problems/h-index/description/), where `citations` is now guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.
- Could you solve it in logarithmic time complexity?

```
class Solution {
    public int hIndex(int[] c) {
        int a=0;
        for(int i=0; i<c.length/2; i++){
            int tmp = c[i];
            c[i] = c[c.length -i -1];
            c[c.length -i -1] = tmp;
        }
        while(a<c.length && a<c[a]){
            a++;
        }
        return a;
    }
}
```

```
class Solution {
    public int hIndex(int[] c) {
        int len=c.length,l=0, r=len-1,mid=0;
        while(l<=r){
            mid=l+(r-l)/2;
            if(c[mid]==len-mid){
                return len-mid;
            }else if(c[mid]<len-mid){
                l=mid+1;
            }else{
                r=mid-1;
            }
        }
        return len-l;
    }
}
```
