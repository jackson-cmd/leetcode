There are *N* children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

- Each child must have at least one candy.
- Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.

What is the minimum candies you must give?

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1,0,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [1,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
             The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.
```



```
class Solution {
    public int candy(int[] r) {
        int n=r.length;
        int[] ans=new int[n];
        Arrays.fill(ans,1);
        for(int i=1;i<n;++i){
            if(r[i-1]<r[i]){
                ans[i]=ans[i-1]+1;
            }
        }
        for(int i=n-1;i>0;--i){
            if(r[i]<r[i-1] && ans[i-1]<ans[i]+2){
                ans[i-1]=ans[i]+1;
            }
        }
        return Arrays.stream(ans).sum();
    }
}
```
